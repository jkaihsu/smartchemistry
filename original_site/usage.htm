<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you have trouble adapting to the nicotine
patch, nicotine inhaler, or even the nicotine gum, the Health Cigarette Filter might be the
solution for you. The Health Cigarette Filter was designed to slowly wean a smoker from
cigarettes to nicotine patch, gum, or inhaler. If you find your compliance with
the nicotine patch (or other products) low, do not be discouraged. Numerous
studies have found compliance low. Using the Health Cigarette Filter may be the key to helping
one move painlessly without withdrawal from smoking to patch, gum, or inhaler
alone. Length of time in going from a cigarette with Health Cigarette Filter to products such as the
patch, gum, or inhaler depends on the user. Some may quickly decrease the amount
of smoking per day while others may take more time. The goal is to slowly switch
the nicotine source form cigarette to a nontobacco nicotine product without
withdrawal. Then from there, one should ideally decrease his or her dependence
on the patch, gum, or inhaler itself. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Remember the Health Cigarette Filter <u> does not make smoking
safe</u>. It decreases the amount of carcinogenic compounds inhaled, thus decreasing
chances of lung cancer and other related illnesses due to lung damage such as
emphysema, asthma, bronchitis, and congestive pulmonary obstructive disease. It
does not decrease the effects of nicotine, thus risks of coronary artery
disease, myocardial infarctions, hypertension, stroke, and transient ischemic
attacks are still present. </font>
