        Chemistry Corporation (SCC) made the decision to dedicate its facilities
        and resources to unrestricted research in the realm of quality of 
		hydrogen for fuel cell, environmental and
        analytical chemistry. SCC research and development has always been on
        the cutting edge, pushing above and beyond what is thought possible.
        From the everyday products we see to the inconceivable, our dedication
        and efforts are obviously demonstrated. Of course this would not have
        been possible without you, the client. The combination of&nbsp;
        teamwork, flexibility, and innovation has made many ideas become a
        reality.</font>
